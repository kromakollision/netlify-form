# Netlify About Page Template

This repository accompanies my article: [Publish an about page with a contact form on Netlify in less than 2 hours](https://medium.com/@koen.buckinx/publish-an-about-page-with-a-contact-form-on-netlify-in-less-than-2-hours-c84fa8a007d5).

## Getting started

- Fork the repository
- run `npm install`
- run `npm run netlify-login` to login to Netlify (you'll have to create an account first)
- run `npm run netlify-init` to link a Github repo to your Netlify project  
  You can do this setup manually in Netlify as well
- start editing your HTML and commit your changes

Any code committed to the `main` branch will be deployed, so it's best to set up a `development` branch for your work in progress!
